Recently I got an invite to participate in Google's Foorbar challenge, and this repository is where I will store my solutions.

I could only get past Level 2.2 out of 6 because the challenges to follow required advanced mathematical skills. Brute forcing my way to a solution proved futile because of the one second per test case time limit.
