Recently I got an invite to participate in Google's Foorbar challenge, and this repository is where I will store my solutions.

I chose Java as my programming language of choice because most the solutions posted online were in Python. This sparked a bit of rebellion in me to show that the problems could also be done in Java.

Unfortunately, I could only get past Level 2.2 out of 6 because the challenges to follow required advanced mathematical skills. Brute forcing my way to a solution proved futile because of the one second per test case time limit. Plagiarising a solution was not something I wanted to do.
